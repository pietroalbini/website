### Building the blog

In order to build the blog you need to have Ruby and Bundler installed on your
system, as well as make. Then, you just need to run this command:

```
$ make
```

The website's HTML files will be located in `build`. If you want to
auto-rebuild the website on any change and serve it locally you can instead use
this command:

```
$ make serve
```

A webserver will be started on port 8000.
