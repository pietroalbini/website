title: About me
---

I'm Pietro, a CS student and Mozilla contractor working on the [Rust
programming language][rust]. I started contributing as a volunteer to the Rust
project in 2018, and I'm now the co-lead of the [Infrastructure
Team][infra-team], a member of the [Release Team][release-team], [crates.io
Team][cratesio-team], and [Security Response WG][wg-security-response].

In the past I was involved in the [Ubuntu italian community][ubuntu-it], and I
created a few small open source projects you can find in my [GitHub
account][gh]. Most of these projects are not maintained anymore but I
occasionally do a few tweaks to them when it's necessary.

My email address is [pietro@pietroalbini.org](mailto:pietro@pietroalbini.org),
and if you need to report a security issue of a project I maintain this is [my
GPG key](/gpg). **Do not** email me vulnerabilities of the Rust programming
language, follow [the project's policy][rust-security-policy] instead.
